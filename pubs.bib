abstract="A hybrid-switched data center network interconnects its racks of servers with a combination of a fast circuit switch that a schedule can reconfigure at significant cost and a much slower packet switch that a schedule can reconfigure at negligible cost. Given a traffic demand matrix between the racks, how can we best compute a good circuit switch configuration schedule that meets most of the traffic demand, leaving as little as possible for the packet switch to handle?",
